    Notes
    -----
    The variable create_using should be a Graph Constructor or a
    "graph"-like object. Constructors, e.g. `nx.Graph` or `nx.MultiGraph`
    will be used to create the returned graph. "graph"-like objects
    will be cleared (nodes and edges will be removed) and refitted as
    an empty "graph" with nodes specified in n. This capability
    is useful for specifying the class-nature of the resulting empty
    "graph" (i.e. Graph, DiGraph, MyWeirdGraphClass, etc.).

    The variable create_using has three main uses:
    Firstly, the variable create_using can be used to create an
    empty digraph, multigraph, etc.  For example,

    >>> n = 10
    >>> G = nx.empty_graph(n, create_using=nx.DiGraph)

    will create an empty digraph on n nodes.

    Secondly, one can pass an existing graph (digraph, multigraph,
    etc.) via create_using. For example, if G is an existing graph
    (resp. digraph, multigraph, etc.), then empty_graph(n, create_using=G)
    will empty G (i.e. delete all nodes and edges using G.clear())
    and then add n nodes and zero edges, and return the modified graph.

    Thirdly, when constructing your home-grown graph creation function
    you can use empty_graph to construct the graph by passing a user
    defined create_using to empty_graph. In this case, if you want the
    default constructor to be other than nx.Graph, specify `default`.

    >>> def mygraph(n, create_using=None):
    ...     G = nx.empty_graph(n, create_using, nx.MultiGraph)
    ...     G.add_edges_from([(0, 1), (0, 1)])
    ...     return G
    >>> G = mygraph(3)

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int or iterable
        If an integer, node labels are 0 to n with center 0.
        If an iterable of nodes, the center is the first.
        Warning: n is not checked for duplicates and if present the
        resulting graph may not be as desired. Make sure you have no duplicates.
    create_using : NetworkX graph constructor, optional (default=nx.Graph)
       Graph type to create. If graph instance, then cleared before populated.

    Node labels are the integers 0 to n - 1.

def complete_multipartite_graph(*subset_sizes):
    """Returns the complete multipartite graph with the specified subset sizes.

    .. plot::

        >>> nx.draw(nx.complete_multipartite_graph(1, 2, 3))

    Parameters
    ----------
    subset_sizes : tuple of integers or tuple of node iterables
       The arguments can either all be integer number of nodes or they
       can all be iterables of nodes. If integers, they represent the
       number of nodes in each subset of the multipartite graph.
       If iterables, each is used to create the nodes for that subset.
       The length of subset_sizes is the number of subsets.

    Returns
    -------
    G : NetworkX Graph
       Returns the complete multipartite graph with the specified subsets.

       For each node, the node attribute 'subset' is an integer
       indicating which subset contains the node.

    Examples
    --------
    Creating a complete tripartite graph, with subsets of one, two, and three
    nodes, respectively.

        >>> G = nx.complete_multipartite_graph(1, 2, 3)
        >>> [G.nodes[u]["subset"] for u in G]
        [0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]
        >>> list(G.edges(0))
        [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5)]
        >>> list(G.edges(2))
        [(2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5)]
        >>> list(G.edges(4))
        [(4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)]

        >>> G = nx.complete_multipartite_graph("a", "bc", "def")
        >>> [G.nodes[u]["subset"] for u in sorted(G)]
        [0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]

    Notes
    -----
    This function generalizes several other graph builder functions.

    - If no subset sizes are given, this returns the null graph.
    - If a single subset size `n` is given, this returns the empty graph on
      `n` nodes.
    - If two subset sizes `m` and `n` are given, this returns the complete
      bipartite graph on `m + n` nodes.
    - If subset sizes `1` and `n` are given, this returns the star graph on
      `n + 1` nodes.
