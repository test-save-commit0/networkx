    Parameters
    ----------
    L : Laplacian of a possibly weighted or normalized, but undirected graph

    X : Initial guess for a solution. Usually a matrix of random numbers.
        This function allows more than one column in X to identify more than

    sigma, X : Two NumPy arrays of floats.
