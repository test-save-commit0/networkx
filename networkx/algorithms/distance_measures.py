    """Compute requested extreme distance metric of undirected graph G

    Computation is based on smart lower and upper bounds, and in practice
    linear in the number of nodes, rather than quadratic (except for some
    border cases such as complete graphs or circle shaped graphs).

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
       An undirected graph

    compute : string denoting the requesting metric
       "diameter" for the maximal eccentricity value,
       "radius" for the minimal eccentricity value,
       "periphery" for the set of nodes with eccentricity equal to the diameter,
       "center" for the set of nodes with eccentricity equal to the radius,
       "eccentricities" for the maximum distance from each node to all other nodes in G

    weight : string, function, or None
        If this is a string, then edge weights will be accessed via the
        edge attribute with this key (that is, the weight of the edge
        joining `u` to `v` will be ``G.edges[u, v][weight]``). If no
        such edge attribute exists, the weight of the edge is assumed to
        be one.

        If this is a function, the weight of an edge is the value
        returned by the function. The function must accept exactly three
        positional arguments: the two endpoints of an edge and the
        dictionary of edge attributes for that edge. The function must
        return a number.

        If this is None, every edge has weight/distance/cost 1.

        Weights stored as floating point values can lead to small round-off
        errors in distances. Use integer weights to avoid this.

        Weights should be positive, since they are distances.

    Returns
    -------
    value : value of the requested metric
       int for "diameter" and "radius" or
       list of nodes for "center" and "periphery" or
       dictionary of eccentricity values keyed by node for "eccentricities"

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        If the graph consists of multiple components
    ValueError
        If `compute` is not one of "diameter", "radius", "periphery", "center", or "eccentricities".
