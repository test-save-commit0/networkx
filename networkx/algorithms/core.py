Find the k-cores of a graph.

The k-core is found by recursively pruning nodes with degrees less than k.

Generalized Cores

https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0202039

For directed graphs a more general notion is that of D-cores which
looks at (k, l) restrictions on (in, out) degree. The (k, k) D-core
is the k-core.
