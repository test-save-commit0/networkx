def chain_decomposition(G, root=None):
    """Returns the chain decomposition of a graph.

    The *chain decomposition* of a graph with respect a depth-first
    search tree is a set of cycles or paths derived from the set of
    fundamental cycles of the tree in the following manner. Consider
    each fundamental cycle with respect to the given tree, represented
    as a list of edges beginning with the nontree edge oriented away
    from the root of the tree. For each fundamental cycle, if it
    overlaps with any previous fundamental cycle, just take the initial
    non-overlapping segment, which is a path instead of a cycle. Each
    cycle or path is called a *chain*. For more information, see [1]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : undirected graph

    root : node (optional)
       A node in the graph `G`. If specified, only the chain
       decomposition for the connected component containing this node
       will be returned. This node indicates the root of the depth-first
       search tree.

    Yields
    ------
    chain : list
       A list of edges representing a chain. There is no guarantee on
       the orientation of the edges in each chain (for example, if a
       chain includes the edge joining nodes 1 and 2, the chain may
       include either (1, 2) or (2, 1)).

    Raises
    ------
    NodeNotFound
       If `root` is not in the graph `G`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.Graph([(0, 1), (1, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)])
    >>> list(nx.chain_decomposition(G))
    [[(4, 5), (5, 3), (3, 4)]]

    Notes
    -----
    The worst-case running time of this implementation is linear in the
    number of nodes and number of edges [1]_.
