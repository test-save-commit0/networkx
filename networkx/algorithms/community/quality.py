    """Returns the modularity of the given partition of the graph.

    Modularity is defined in [1]_ as

    .. math::
        Q = \\frac{1}{2m} \\sum_{ij} \\left( A_{ij} - \\gamma\\frac{k_ik_j}{2m}\\right)
            \\delta(c_i,c_j)

    where $m$ is the number of edges (or sum of all edge weights as in [5]_),
    $A$ is the adjacency matrix of `G`, $k_i$ is the (weighted) degree of $i$,
    $\\gamma$ is the resolution parameter, and $\\delta(c_i, c_j)$ is 1 if $i$ and
    $j$ are in the same community else 0.

    According to [2]_ (and verified by some algebra) this can be reduced to

    .. math::
       Q = \\sum_{c=1}^{n}
       \\left[ \\frac{L_c}{m} - \\gamma\\left( \\frac{k_c}{2m} \\right) ^2 \\right]

    where the sum iterates over all communities $c$, $m$ is the number of edges,
    $L_c$ is the number of intra-community links for community $c$,
    $k_c$ is the sum of degrees of the nodes in community $c$,
    and $\\gamma$ is the resolution parameter.

    The resolution parameter sets an arbitrary tradeoff between intra-group
    edges and inter-group edges. More complex grouping patterns can be
    discovered by analyzing the same network with multiple values of gamma
    and then combining the results [3]_. That said, it is very common to
    simply use gamma=1. More on the choice of gamma is in [4]_.

    The second formula is the one actually used in calculation of the modularity.
    For directed graphs the second formula replaces $k_c$ with $k^{in}_c k^{out}_c$.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX Graph

    communities : list or iterable of set of nodes
        These node sets must represent a partition of G's nodes.

    weight : string or None, optional (default="weight")
        The edge attribute that holds the numerical value used
        as a weight. If None or an edge does not have that attribute,
        then that edge has weight 1.

    resolution : float (default=1)
        If resolution is less than 1, modularity favors larger communities.
        Greater than 1 favors smaller communities.

    Returns
    -------
    Q : float
        The modularity of the partition.

    Raises
    ------
    NotAPartition
        If `communities` is not a partition of the nodes of `G`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.barbell_graph(3, 0)
    >>> nx.community.modularity(G, [{0, 1, 2}, {3, 4, 5}])
    0.35714285714285715
    >>> nx.community.modularity(G, nx.community.label_propagation_communities(G))

def partition_quality(G, partition):
    """Returns the coverage and performance of a partition of G.

    The *coverage* of a partition is the ratio of the number of
    intra-community edges to the total number of edges in the graph.

    The *performance* of a partition is the number of
    intra-community edges plus inter-community non-edges divided by the total
    number of potential edges.

    This algorithm has complexity $O(C^2 + L)$ where C is the number of communities and L is the number of links.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    partition : sequence
        Partition of the nodes of `G`, represented as a sequence of
        sets of nodes (blocks). Each block of the partition represents a
        community.

    Returns
    -------
    (float, float)
        The (coverage, performance) tuple of the partition, as defined above.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        If `partition` is not a valid partition of the nodes of `G`.

    Notes
    -----
    If `G` is a multigraph;
        - for coverage, the multiplicity of edges is counted
        - for performance, the result is -1 (total number of possible edges is not defined)
