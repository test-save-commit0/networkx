    Notes
    -----
    A (combinatorial) embedding consists of cyclic orderings of the incident
    edges at each vertex. Given such an embedding there are multiple approaches
    discussed in literature to drawing the graph (subject to various
    constraints, e.g. integer coordinates), see e.g. [2].

    The planarity check algorithm and extraction of the combinatorial embedding
    is based on the Left-Right Planarity Test [1].

    A counterexample is only generated if the corresponding parameter is set,
    because the complexity of the counterexample generation is higher.

class PlanarEmbedding(nx.DiGraph):
    """Represents a planar graph with its planar embedding.

    The planar embedding is given by a `combinatorial embedding
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_embedding#Combinatorial_embedding>`_.

    .. note:: `check_planarity` is the preferred way to check if a graph is planar.

    **Neighbor ordering:**

    In comparison to a usual graph structure, the embedding also stores the
    order of all neighbors for every vertex.
    The order of the neighbors can be given in clockwise (cw) direction or
    counterclockwise (ccw) direction. This order is stored as edge attributes
    in the underlying directed graph. For the edge (u, v) the edge attribute
    'cw' is set to the neighbor of u that follows immediately after v in
    clockwise direction.

    In order for a PlanarEmbedding to be valid it must fulfill multiple
    conditions. It is possible to check if these conditions are fulfilled with
    the method :meth:`check_structure`.
    The conditions are:

    * Edges must go in both directions (because the edge attributes differ)
    * Every edge must have a 'cw' and 'ccw' attribute which corresponds to a
      correct planar embedding.

    As long as a PlanarEmbedding is invalid only the following methods should
    be called:

    * :meth:`add_half_edge`
    * :meth:`connect_components`

    Even though the graph is a subclass of nx.DiGraph, it can still be used
    for algorithms that require undirected graphs, because the method
    :meth:`is_directed` is overridden. This is possible, because a valid
    PlanarGraph must have edges in both directions.

    **Half edges:**

    In methods like `add_half_edge` the term "half-edge" is used, which is
    a term that is used in `doubly connected edge lists
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_connected_edge_list>`_. It is used
    to emphasize that the edge is only in one direction and there exists
    another half-edge in the opposite direction.
    While conventional edges always have two faces (including outer face) next
    to them, it is possible to assign each half-edge *exactly one* face.
    For a half-edge (u, v) that is oriented such that u is below v then the
    face that belongs to (u, v) is to the right of this half-edge.

    See Also
    --------
    is_planar :
        Preferred way to check if an existing graph is planar.

    check_planarity :
        A convenient way to create a `PlanarEmbedding`. If not planar,
        it returns a subgraph that shows this.

    Examples
    --------

    Create an embedding of a star graph (compare `nx.star_graph(3)`):

    >>> G = nx.PlanarEmbedding()
    >>> G.add_half_edge(0, 1)
    >>> G.add_half_edge(0, 2, ccw=1)
    >>> G.add_half_edge(0, 3, ccw=2)
    >>> G.add_half_edge(1, 0)
    >>> G.add_half_edge(2, 0)
    >>> G.add_half_edge(3, 0)

    Alternatively the same embedding can also be defined in counterclockwise
    orientation. The following results in exactly the same PlanarEmbedding:

    >>> G = nx.PlanarEmbedding()
    >>> G.add_half_edge(0, 1)
    >>> G.add_half_edge(0, 3, cw=1)
    >>> G.add_half_edge(0, 2, cw=3)
    >>> G.add_half_edge(1, 0)
    >>> G.add_half_edge(2, 0)
    >>> G.add_half_edge(3, 0)

    After creating a graph, it is possible to validate that the PlanarEmbedding
    object is correct:
