Time-respecting VF2 Algorithm
*****************************

An extension of the VF2 algorithm for time-respecting graph isomorphism
testing in temporal graphs.

A temporal graph is one in which edges contain a datetime attribute,
denoting when interaction occurred between the incident nodes. A
time-respecting subgraph of a temporal graph is a subgraph such that
all interactions incident to a node occurred within a time threshold,
delta, of each other. A directed time-respecting subgraph has the
added constraint that incoming interactions to a node must precede
outgoing interactions from the same node - this enforces a sense of
directed flow.

Introduction
------------

The TimeRespectingGraphMatcher and TimeRespectingDiGraphMatcher
extend the GraphMatcher and DiGraphMatcher classes, respectively,
to include temporal constraints on matches. This is achieved through
a semantic check, via the semantic_feasibility() function.

As well as including G1 (the graph in which to seek embeddings) and
G2 (the subgraph structure of interest), the name of the temporal
attribute on the edges and the time threshold, delta, must be supplied
as arguments to the matching constructors.

A delta of zero is the strictest temporal constraint on the match -
only embeddings in which all interactions occur at the same time will
be returned. A delta of one day will allow embeddings in which
adjacent interactions occur up to a day apart.

Examples
--------

Examples will be provided when the datetime type has been incorporated.


Temporal Subgraph Isomorphism
-----------------------------

A brief discussion of the somewhat diverse current literature will be
included here.
