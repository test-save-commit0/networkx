    The *modular product* is defined in [1]_ and was first
    introduced as the *weak modular product*.

    The modular product reduces the problem of counting isomorphic subgraphs
    in `G` and `H` to the problem of counting cliques in M. The subgraphs of
    `G` and `H` that are induced by the nodes of a clique in M are
    isomorphic [2]_ [3]_.
