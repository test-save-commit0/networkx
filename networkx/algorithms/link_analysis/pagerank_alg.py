    """Returns the PageRank of the nodes in the graph.

    PageRank computes a ranking of the nodes in the graph G based on
    the structure of the incoming links. It was originally designed as
    an algorithm to rank web pages.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
      A NetworkX graph.  Undirected graphs will be converted to a directed
      graph with two directed edges for each undirected edge.

    alpha : float, optional
      Damping parameter for PageRank, default=0.85.

    personalization: dict, optional
      The "personalization vector" consisting of a dictionary with a
      key some subset of graph nodes and personalization value each of those.
      At least one personalization value must be non-zero.
      If not specified, a nodes personalization value will be zero.
      By default, a uniform distribution is used.

    max_iter : integer, optional
      Maximum number of iterations in power method eigenvalue solver.

    tol : float, optional
      Error tolerance used to check convergence in power method solver.
      The iteration will stop after a tolerance of ``len(G) * tol`` is reached.

    nstart : dictionary, optional
      Starting value of PageRank iteration for each node.

    weight : key, optional
      Edge data key to use as weight.  If None weights are set to 1.

    dangling: dict, optional
      The outedges to be assigned to any "dangling" nodes, i.e., nodes without
      any outedges. The dict key is the node the outedge points to and the dict
      value is the weight of that outedge. By default, dangling nodes are given
      outedges according to the personalization vector (uniform if not
      specified). This must be selected to result in an irreducible transition
      matrix (see notes under google_matrix). It may be common to have the
      dangling dict to be the same as the personalization dict.


    Returns
    -------
    pagerank : dictionary
       Dictionary of nodes with PageRank as value

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.DiGraph(nx.path_graph(4))
    >>> pr = nx.pagerank(G, alpha=0.9)

    Notes
    -----
    The eigenvector calculation is done by the power iteration method
    and has no guarantee of convergence.  The iteration will stop after
    an error tolerance of ``len(G) * tol`` has been reached. If the
    number of iterations exceed `max_iter`, a
    :exc:`networkx.exception.PowerIterationFailedConvergence` exception
    is raised.

    The PageRank algorithm was designed for directed graphs but this
    algorithm does not check if the input graph is directed and will
    execute on undirected graphs by converting each edge in the
    directed graph to two edges.

    google_matrix

    Raises
    ------
    PowerIterationFailedConvergence
        If the algorithm fails to converge to the specified tolerance
        within the specified number of iterations of the power iteration
        method.

    ----------
    G : graph
      A NetworkX graph.  Undirected graphs will be converted to a directed

    alpha : float
      The damping factor.

    nodelist : list, optional

    Returns
    -------
    A : 2D NumPy ndarray
       Google matrix of the graph

    Notes
    -----
    The array returned represents the transition matrix that describes the
    Markov chain used in PageRank. For PageRank to converge to a unique
    solution (i.e., a unique stationary distribution in a Markov chain), the
    transition matrix must be irreducible. In other words, it must be that
    there exists a path between every pair of nodes in the graph, or else there
    is the potential of "rank sinks."

    This implementation works with Multi(Di)Graphs. For multigraphs the
    weight between two nodes is set to be the sum of all edge weights
    between those nodes.
