Algorithms for finding k-edge-connected components and subgraphs.

A k-edge-connected component (k-edge-cc) is a maximal set of nodes in G, such
that all pairs of node have an edge-connectivity of at least k.

A k-edge-connected subgraph (k-edge-subgraph) is a maximal set of nodes in G,
such that the subgraph of G defined by the nodes has an edge-connectivity at
least k.

    Constructing the auxiliary graph (which may take some time) allows for the

    Notes
    -----
    This implementation is based on [1]_. The idea is to construct an auxiliary
    graph from which the k-edge-ccs can be extracted in linear time. The
    auxiliary graph is constructed in $O(|V|\\cdot F)$ operations, where F is the
    complexity of max flow. Querying the components takes an additional $O(|V|)$
    operations. This algorithm can be slow for large graphs, but it handles an
    arbitrary k and works for both directed and undirected inputs.

    The undirected case for k=1 is exactly connected components.
    The undirected case for k=2 is exactly bridge connected components.
    The directed case for k=1 is exactly strongly connected components.

    Notes
    -----
    Implementation of the basic algorithm from [1]_.  The basic idea is to find
    a global minimum cut of the graph. If the cut value is at least k, then the
    graph is a k-edge-connected subgraph and can be added to the results.
    Otherwise, the cut is used to split the graph in two and the procedure is
    applied recursively. If the graph is just a single node, then it is also
    added to the results. At the end, each result is either guaranteed to be
    a single node or a subgraph of G that is k-edge-connected.

    This implementation contains optimizations for reducing the number of calls
    to max-flow, but there are other optimizations in [1]_ that could be
    implemented.
