Algorithms for finding k-edge-augmentations

A k-edge-augmentation is a set of edges, that once added to a graph, ensures
that the graph is k-edge-connected; i.e. the graph cannot be disconnected
unless k or more edges are removed.  Typically, the goal is to find the
augmentation with minimum weight.  In general, it is not guaranteed that a
k-edge-augmentation exists.

    """Finds set of edges to k-edge-connect G.

    Adding edges from the augmentation to G make it impossible to disconnect G

    function available (depending on the value of k and if the problem is
    weighted or unweighted) to search for a minimum weight subset of available
    edges that k-edge-connects G. In general, finding a k-edge-augmentation is
    NP-hard, so solutions are not guaranteed to be minimal. Furthermore, a
    k-edge-augmentation may not exist.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
       An undirected graph.

    k : integer
        Desired edge connectivity

    avail : dict or a set of 2 or 3 tuples
        The available edges that can be used in the augmentation.

        If unspecified, then all edges in the complement of G are available.
        Otherwise, each item is an available edge (with an optional weight).

        In the unweighted case, each item is an edge ``(u, v)``.

        In the weighted case, each item is a 3-tuple ``(u, v, d)`` or a dict
        with items ``(u, v): d``.  The third item, ``d``, can be a dictionary
        or a real number.  If ``d`` is a dictionary ``d[weight]``
        correspondings to the weight.

    weight : string
        key to use to find weights if ``avail`` is a set of 3-tuples where the
        third item in each tuple is a dictionary.

    partial : boolean
        If partial is True and no feasible k-edge-augmentation exists, then all
        a partial k-edge-augmentation is generated. Adding the edges in a
        partial augmentation to G, minimizes the number of k-edge-connected
        components and maximizes the edge connectivity between those
        components. For details, see :func:`partial_k_edge_augmentation`.

    Yields
    ------
    edge : tuple
        Edges that, once added to G, would cause G to become k-edge-connected.
        If partial is False, an error is raised if this is not possible.
        Otherwise, generated edges form a partial augmentation, which
        k-edge-connects any part of G where it is possible, and maximally
        connects the remaining parts.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXUnfeasible
        If partial is False and no k-edge-augmentation exists.

    NetworkXNotImplemented
        If the input graph is directed or a multigraph.

    ValueError:
        If k is less than 1

    Notes
    -----
    When k=1 this returns an optimal solution.

    When k=2 and ``avail`` is None, this returns an optimal solution.
    Otherwise when k=2, this returns a 2-approximation of the optimal solution.

    For k>3, this problem is NP-hard and this uses a randomized algorithm that

    This is an implementation of the algorithm detailed in [1]_.
    The basic idea is to construct a meta-graph of bridge-ccs, connect leaf

    leafs of the tree in dfs-preorder to bridge connect the entire graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
       An undirected graph.

    Yields
    ------
    edge : tuple

    Notes
    -----
    Input: a graph G.
    First find the bridge components of G and collapse each bridge-cc into a
    node of a metagraph graph C, which is guaranteed to be a forest of trees.

    C contains p "leafs" --- nodes with exactly one incident edge.
    C contains q "isolated nodes" --- nodes with no incident edges.

    Theorem: If p + q > 1, then at least :math:`ceil(p / 2) + q` edges are
        needed to bridge connect C. This algorithm achieves this min number.

    The method first adds enough edges to make G into a tree and then pairs
    leafs in a simple fashion.

    Let n be the number of trees in C. Let v(i) be an isolated vertex in the
    i-th tree if one exists, otherwise it is a pair of distinct leafs nodes
    in the i-th tree. Alternating edges from these sets (i.e.  adding edges
    A1 = [(v(i)[0], v(i + 1)[1]), v(i + 1)[0], v(i + 2)[1])...]) connects C
    into a tree T. This tree has p' = p + 2q - 2(n -1) leafs and no isolated
    vertices. A1 has n - 1 edges. The next step finds ceil(p' / 2) edges to
    biconnect any tree with p' leafs.

    Convert T into an arborescence T' by picking an arbitrary root node with
    degree >= 2 and directing all edges away from the root. Note the
    implementation implicitly constructs T'.

    The leafs of T are the nodes with no existing edges in T'.
    Order the leafs of T' by DFS preorder. Then break this list in half
    and add the zipped pairs to A2.

    The set A = A1 + A2 is the minimum augmentation in the metagraph.

    arborescence)

    Before the branching can be computed, the directed graph must be rooted by
    removing the predecessors of root.

    A branching / arborescence of rooted graph G is a subgraph that contains a
    directed path from the root to every other vertex. It is the directed
    analog of the minimum spanning tree problem.

def collapse(G, grouped_nodes):
    """Collapses each group of nodes into a single node.

    This is similar to condensation, but works on undirected graphs.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX Graph

    grouped_nodes:  list or generator
       Grouping of nodes to collapse. The grouping must be disjoint.
       If grouped_nodes are strongly_connected_components then this is
       equivalent to :func:`condensation`.

    Returns
    -------
    C : NetworkX Graph
       The collapsed graph C of G with respect to the node grouping.  The node
       labels are integers corresponding to the index of the component in the
       list of grouped_nodes.  C has a graph attribute named 'mapping' with a
       dictionary mapping the original nodes to the nodes in C to which they
       belong.  Each node in C also has a node attribute 'members' with the set
       of original nodes in G that form the group that the node in C
       represents.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> # Collapses a graph using disjoint groups, but not necessarily connected
    >>> G = nx.Graph([(1, 0), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7)])
    >>> G.add_node("A")
    >>> grouped_nodes = [{0, 1, 2, 3}, {5, 6, 7}]
    >>> C = collapse(G, grouped_nodes)
    >>> members = nx.get_node_attributes(C, "members")
    >>> sorted(members.keys())
    [0, 1, 2, 3]
    >>> member_values = set(map(frozenset, members.values()))
    >>> assert {0, 1, 2, 3} in member_values
    >>> assert {4} in member_values

    """Greedy algorithm for finding a k-edge-augmentation

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
       An undirected graph.

    k : integer
        Desired edge connectivity

    avail : dict or a set of 2 or 3 tuples
        For more details, see :func:`k_edge_augmentation`.

    weight : string
        key to use to find weights if ``avail`` is a set of 3-tuples.
        For more details, see :func:`k_edge_augmentation`.

    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
        Indicator of random number generation state.
        See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.

    Yields
    ------
    edge : tuple
        Edges in the greedy augmentation of G

    Notes
    -----
    The algorithm is simple. Edges are incrementally added between parts of the
    graph that are not yet locally k-edge-connected. Then edges are from the
    augmenting set are pruned as long as local-edge-connectivity is not broken.

    This algorithm is greedy and does not provide optimality guarantees. It
    exists only to provide :func:`k_edge_augmentation` with the ability to
    generate a feasible solution for arbitrary k.
