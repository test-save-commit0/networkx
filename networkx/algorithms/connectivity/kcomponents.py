def k_components(G, flow_func=None):
    """Returns the k-component structure of a graph G.

    A `k`-component is a maximal subgraph of a graph G that has, at least,
    node connectivity `k`: we need to remove at least `k` nodes to break it
    into more components. `k`-components have an inherent hierarchical
    structure because they are nested in terms of connectivity: a connected
    graph can contain several 2-components, each of which can contain
    one or more 3-components, and so forth.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    flow_func : function
        Function to perform the underlying flow computations. Default value
        :meth:`edmonds_karp`. This function performs better in sparse graphs with
        right tailed degree distributions. :meth:`shortest_augmenting_path` will
        perform better in denser graphs.

    Returns
    -------
    k_components : dict
        Dictionary with all connectivity levels `k` in the input Graph as keys
        and a list of sets of nodes that form a k-component of level `k` as
        values.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXNotImplemented
        If the input graph is directed.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> # Petersen graph has 10 nodes and it is triconnected, thus all
    >>> # nodes are in a single component on all three connectivity levels
    >>> G = nx.petersen_graph()
    >>> k_components = nx.k_components(G)

    Notes
    -----
    Moody and White [1]_ (appendix A) provide an algorithm for identifying
    k-components in a graph, which is based on Kanevsky's algorithm [2]_
    for finding all minimum-size node cut-sets of a graph (implemented in
    :meth:`all_node_cuts` function):

        1. Compute node connectivity, k, of the input graph G.

        2. Identify all k-cutsets at the current level of connectivity using
           Kanevsky's algorithm.

        3. Generate new graph components based on the removal of
           these cutsets. Nodes in a cutset belong to both sides
           of the induced cut.

        4. If the graph is neither complete nor trivial, return to 1;
           else end.

    This implementation also uses some heuristics (see [3]_ for details)
    to speed up the computation.

    biconnected_components : special case of this function when k=2
    k_edge_components : similar to this function, but uses edge-connectivity
        instead of node-connectivity
