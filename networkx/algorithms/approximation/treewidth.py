"""Functions for computing treewidth decomposition.

Treewidth of an undirected graph is a number associated with the graph.
It can be defined as the size of the largest vertex set (bag) in a tree
decomposition of the graph minus one.

`Wikipedia: Treewidth <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treewidth>`_

The notions of treewidth and tree decomposition have gained their
attractiveness partly because many graph and network problems that are
intractable (e.g., NP-hard) on arbitrary graphs become efficiently
solvable (e.g., with a linear time algorithm) when the treewidth of the
input graphs is bounded by a constant [1]_ [2]_.

There are two different functions for computing a tree decomposition:
:func:`treewidth_min_degree` and :func:`treewidth_min_fill_in`.
