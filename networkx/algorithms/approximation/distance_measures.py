def diameter(G, seed=None):
    """Returns a lower bound on the diameter of the graph G.

    The function computes a lower bound on the diameter (i.e., the maximum eccentricity)
    of a directed or undirected graph G. The procedure used varies depending on the graph
    being directed or not.

    If G is an `undirected` graph, then the function uses the `2-sweep` algorithm [1]_.
    The main idea is to pick the farthest node from a random node and return its eccentricity.

    Otherwise, if G is a `directed` graph, the function uses the `2-dSweep` algorithm [2]_,
    The procedure starts by selecting a random source node $s$ from which it performs a
    forward and a backward BFS. Let $a_1$ and $a_2$ be the farthest nodes in the forward and
    backward cases, respectively. Then, it computes the backward eccentricity of $a_1$ using
    a backward BFS and the forward eccentricity of $a_2$ using a forward BFS.
    Finally, it returns the best lower bound between the two.

    In both cases, the time complexity is linear with respect to the size of G.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
        Indicator of random number generation state.
        See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.

    Returns
    -------
    d : integer
       Lower Bound on the Diameter of G

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.path_graph(10)  # undirected graph
    >>> nx.diameter(G)
    9
    >>> G = nx.cycle_graph(3, create_using=nx.DiGraph)  # directed graph
    >>> nx.diameter(G)
    2

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        If the graph is empty or
        If the graph is undirected and not connected or
        If the graph is directed and not strongly connected.

        The algorithm follows the following steps.
        1. Select a source node $s$ at random.
        2. Perform a forward BFS from $s$ to select a node $a_1$ at the maximum
