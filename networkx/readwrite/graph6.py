"""Functions for reading and writing graphs in the *graph6* format.

The *graph6* file format is suitable for small graphs or large dense
graphs. For large sparse graphs, use the *sparse6* format.

For more information, see the `graph6`_ homepage.

    `G` is an undirected simple graph. `nodes` is the list of nodes for
    which the node-induced subgraph will be encoded; if `nodes` is the
    list of all nodes in the graph, the entire graph will be
    encoded. `header` is a Boolean that specifies whether to generate
    the header ``b'>>graph6<<'`` before the remaining data.

    This function generates `bytes` objects in the following order:

    1. the header (if requested),
    2. the encoding of the number of nodes,
    3. each character, one-at-a-time, in the encoding of the requested
       node-induced subgraph,
    4. a newline character.

    This function raises :exc:`ValueError` if the graph is too large for
    the graph6 format (that is, greater than ``2 ** 36`` nodes).
